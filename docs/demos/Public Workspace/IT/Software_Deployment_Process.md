# Software Deployment Process

## Overview
This document outlines the standardized process for deploying software applications across the organization's infrastructure.

## Purpose
- Ensure consistent and reliable software deployments
- Minimize deployment-related downtime
- Maintain system security and compliance
- Enable rapid rollback capabilities

## Process Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Planning
- **Requirements Review**: Verify all technical and business requirements
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential risks and system dependencies
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate server resources and personnel
- **Backup Strategy**: Create comprehensive system backups
- **Communication Plan**: Notify stakeholders of deployment schedule

### 2. Development Environment Testing
- Complete unit testing and integration testing
- Perform security vulnerability scans
- Validate performance benchmarks
- Document test results and sign-offs

### 3. Staging Environment Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment that mirrors production
- Execute full regression testing suite
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT)
- Performance and load testing validation
- Security testing and compliance checks

### 4. Production Deployment
- **Deployment Window**: Execute during approved maintenance windows
- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. Final backup verification
  2. Deploy application binaries
  3. Update configuration files
  4. Database schema updates (if applicable)
  5. Service restart and validation
  6. Smoke testing

### 5. Post-Deployment Validation
- System health monitoring
- Application functionality verification
- Performance metrics validation
- User access and authentication testing
- Documentation updates

### 6. Rollback Procedures
- Immediate rollback triggers:
  - Critical functionality failures
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance degradation > 20%
  - Data integrity issues

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Development Team** | Code preparation, unit testing, deployment scripts |
| **QA Team** | Testing validation, UAT coordination |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Infrastructure preparation, deployment execution |
| **Security Team** | Security validation, compliance verification |
| **Project Manager** | Coordination, communication, timeline management |

## Tools and Technologies
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights, New Relic, or Datadog
- **Backup Solutions**: Azure Backup, Veeam, or custom scripts
- **Communication**: Teams, Slack, or email notifications

## Checklist Template

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Requirements documented and approved
- [ ] Development testing completed
- [ ] Security scan passed

## Best Practices
1. **Automate Everything**: Use automated deployment pipelines where possible
2. **Test Early, Test Often**: Implement comprehensive testing at every stage
3. **Monitor Continuously**: Set up real-time monitoring and alerting
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Maintain detailed deployment logs and documentation
5. **Learn from Failures**: Conduct post-incident reviews for failed deployments
