# Schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM
1. Pre-backup validation checks
2. Database consistency checks
3. Incremental file system backup
4. Application-specific backups
5. Backup verification and validation
6. Email notification to IT team
```

#### Manual Verification Steps
- [ ] Backup job completion status
- [ ] Backup file size and integrity verification
- [ ] Error log review and analysis
- [ ] Storage capacity monitoring
- [ ] Offsite backup synchronization status

### 2. Weekly Full Backup Process

#### System Preparation
1. **Service Coordination**: Notify users of potential performance impact
2. **Resource Verification**: Ensure adequate storage space and bandwidth
3. **System Health Check**: Verify all systems are running optimally
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify system interdependencies

#### Backup Execution
1. **Database Backups**:
   - SQL Server: Full database backup with transaction log backup
   - Oracle: RMAN full backup with archive log backup
   - MongoDB: mongodump with consistent point-in-time backup

2. **File System Backups**:
   - Windows Servers: Windows Server Backup or third-party tools
   - Linux Servers: rsync, tar, or enterprise backup solutions
   - Network Attached Storage: Snapshot-based backups

3. **Application Backups**:
   - Configuration files and settings
   - Application logs and audit trails
   - Custom scripts and automation tools

### 3. Backup Validation and Testing

#### Automated Validation
- Backup file integrity checks (checksums)
- Restoration test sampling (10% of backups monthly)
- Backup catalog verification
- Storage system health monitoring

#### Monthly Recovery Testing
- Select random backup sets for full restoration testing
- Document recovery time and any issues encountered
- Verify data integrity and application functionality
- Update recovery procedures based on test results

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Recovery Planning

#### Recovery Assessment
- **Incident Classification**: Determine cause and scope of data loss
- **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate business impact and recovery priorities
- **Recovery Strategy**: Select appropriate recovery method and timeline
- **Resource Requirements**: Identify personnel, hardware, and software needs

#### Recovery Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recovery Method | Estimated Time | Business Impact |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Single file corruption | File-level restore | 15 minutes | Minimal |
| Database corruption | Database restore | 1-2 hours | Moderate |
| Server hardware failure | Full system restore | 4-8 hours | High |
| Site-wide disaster | Disaster recovery site | 8-24 hours | Critical |

### 2. System Recovery Process

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Recovery (0-2 hours)
1. **Hardware Assessment**: Verify or replace failed hardware
2. **Network Connectivity**: Establish network connections and routing
3. **Base Operating System**: Install or restore OS from backup
4. **Security Configuration**: Apply security patches and configurations

#### Phase 2: Data Recovery (2-6 hours)
1. **Database Restoration**:
   ```sql
   -- Example SQL Server restore process
   RESTORE DATABASE [ProductionDB] 
   FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\ProductionDB_Full.bak'
   WITH REPLACE, NORECOVERY
   
   RESTORE LOG [ProductionDB] 
   FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\ProductionDB_Log.trn'
   WITH RECOVERY
   ```

2. **File System Recovery**:
   - Restore critical application files
   - Recover user data and documents
   - Restore configuration files and settings

#### Phase 3: Application Recovery (4-8 hours)
1. **Service Installation**: Install and configure applications
2. **Configuration Restoration**: Apply application settings and configurations
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify system integrations and dependencies
4. **User Access Testing**: Validate authentication and authorization

#### Phase 4: Validation and Handover (6-12 hours)
1. **Functionality Testing**: Comprehensive application testing
2. **Performance Validation**: Verify system performance meets requirements
3. **Data Integrity Checks**: Validate data consistency and completeness
4. **User Acceptance**: Obtain user confirmation of system functionality

### 3. Emergency Recovery Procedures

#### Rapid Recovery for Critical Systems
- **Hot Standby Systems**: Immediate failover to redundant systems
- **Database Mirroring**: Automatic failover to mirror databases
- **Virtual Machine Snapshots**: Quick restoration from recent snapshots
- **Cloud-based Recovery**: Restore to cloud infrastructure if needed
