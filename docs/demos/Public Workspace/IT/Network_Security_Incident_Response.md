# Network Security Incident Response

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive procedures for identifying, containing, and resolving network security incidents to protect organizational assets and data.

## Purpose
- Rapidly identify and respond to security threats
- Minimize impact and damage from security incidents
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
- Maintain business continuity during incidents

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to business operations | 15 minutes | Data breach, ransomware, critical system compromise |
| **High** | Significant security risk | 1 hour | Malware outbreak, unauthorized access, DDoS attack |
| **Medium** | Moderate security concern | 4 hours | Suspicious network activity, policy violations |
| **Low** | Minor security issue | 24 hours | Failed login attempts, minor policy violations |

## Response Process

### 1. Detection and Analysis (0-30 minutes)
- **Initial Alert**: Security tools, user reports, or monitoring systems
- **Triage Assessment**: Determine incident severity and classification
- **Evidence Collection**: Preserve logs, screenshots, and system states
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate affected systems and potential data exposure

#### Detection Sources
- SIEM alerts and monitoring tools
- Antivirus and endpoint detection systems
- Network intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- User reports and help desk tickets
- Automated security scanning tools

### 2. Containment (30 minutes - 2 hours)
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate affected systems from network
  - Disable compromised user accounts
  - Block malicious IP addresses and domains
  - Preserve system images for forensic analysis

#### Short-term Containment
- Network segmentation and traffic blocking
- System isolation and quarantine
- Account lockouts and password resets
- Temporary workarounds for business continuity

#### Long-term Containment
- System patching and security updates
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Additional access controls and restrictions
- Temporary security measures implementation

### 3. Eradication (2-8 hours)
- **Threat Removal**:
  - Remove malware and malicious files
  - Close security vulnerabilities
  - Apply security patches and updates
  - Strengthen security configurations

- **System Hardening**:
  - Update security policies and procedures
  - Implement additional security controls
  - Enhance monitoring and detection capabilities
  - Review and update access permissions

### 4. Recovery (4-24 hours)
- **System Restoration**:
  - Restore systems from clean backups
  - Rebuild compromised systems
  - Implement security improvements
  - Gradual return to normal operations

- **Validation Steps**:
  - Security testing and validation
  - Functionality verification
  - Performance monitoring
  - User access testing

### 5. Lessons Learned (1-2 weeks post-incident)
- **Post-Incident Review**:
  - Timeline analysis and documentation
  - Response effectiveness evaluation
  - Process improvement recommendations
  - Training and awareness updates
