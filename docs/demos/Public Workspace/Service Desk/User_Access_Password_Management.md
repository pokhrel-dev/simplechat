# User Access and Password Management

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive procedures for managing user access requests, password resets, account provisioning, and related security processes within the organization's IT environment.

## Purpose
- Ensure secure and efficient user access management
- Maintain compliance with security policies and regulations
- Provide timely access provisioning and password support
- Protect organizational resources from unauthorized access

## Access Management Framework

### Access Control Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum access required for job functions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access based on organizational roles and responsibilities
- **Segregation of Duties**: Critical functions require multiple approvals
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodic verification of user access requirements

### Access Categories

| Access Type | Description | Approval Required | Review Frequency |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Standard User** | Basic email, file shares, common applications | Manager | Annual |
| **Power User** | Additional applications, local admin rights | Manager + IT | Bi-annual |
| **Privileged User** | Administrative access, sensitive systems | Manager + Security | Quarterly |
| **External User** | Contractors, vendors, temporary access | Sponsor + Security | Monthly |
