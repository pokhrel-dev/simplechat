# Feature Release

### **(v0.229.061)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat Page Top Navigation Left Sidebar Fix**
    *   Fixed positioning and layout issues when using top navigation mode where the chat page left-hand menu was overlapping with the top navigation bar.
    *   Created a new short sidebar template (`_sidebar_short_nav.html`) optimized for top navigation layout without brand/logo area.
    *   Modified chat page layout to hide built-in left pane when top nav is enabled, preventing redundant navigation elements.
    *   Implemented proper positioning calculations to account for top navigation bar height with and without classification banner.
    *   (Ref: `_sidebar_short_nav.html`, `base.html`, `chats.html`, conditional template inclusion, layout positioning fixes)

### **(v0.229.058)**

#### New Features

*   **Admin Left-Hand Navigation Enhancement**
    *   Introduced an innovative dual-navigation approach for admin settings, providing both traditional top-nav tabs and a modern left-hand hierarchical navigation system.
    *   **Key Features**: Conditional navigation that automatically detects layout preference, hierarchical structure with two-level navigation (tabs → sections), smart state management for active states and submenus.
    *   **Comprehensive Organization**: All admin tabs now include organized sub-sections with proper section targeting for enhanced navigation.
    *   **Benefits**: Matches conversation navigation patterns users already know, provides better organization for complex admin settings, enables bookmarkable deep links to specific sections.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `_sidebar_nav.html`, `admin_sidebar_nav.js`)

*   **Time-Based Logging Turnoff Feature**
    *   Provides administrators with automatic turnoff capabilities for debug logging and file process logging to manage costs and security risks.
    *   **Cost Management**: Prevents excessive logging costs by automatically disabling logging after specified time periods (minutes to weeks).
    *   **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces security risks by ensuring debug logging doesn't remain enabled indefinitely.
    *   **Configuration Options**: Supports time ranges from 1-120 minutes, 1-24 hours, 1-7 days, and 1-52 weeks for both debug logging and file processing logs.
    *   **Background Monitoring**: Daemon thread monitors and enforces timer expiration automatically.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `app.py`)

*   **Comprehensive Table Support Enhancement**
    *   Enhanced table rendering to support multiple input formats ensuring tables from AI agents or users are properly displayed as styled HTML tables.
    *   **Format Support**: Unicode box-drawing tables (┌─┬─┐ style), markdown tables wrapped in code blocks, pipe-separated values (PSV) in code blocks, standard markdown tables.
    *   **Processing Pipeline**: Implements preprocessing pipeline that detects and converts various table formats to standard markdown before parsing.
    *   **Bootstrap Integration**: All generated tables automatically receive Bootstrap styling with striped rows and responsive design.
    *   (Ref: `chat-messages.js`, table conversion functions, functional tests)

*   **Public Workspace Management Enhancement**
    *   Added "Go to Public Workspace" button to Public Workspace Management page for quick navigation from management to workspace usage.
    *   **User Experience**: One-click navigation from management page to public workspace, automatically sets workspace as active for the user.

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Admin Configuration Improvements**
    *   Addressed user feedback about admin settings organization and implemented critical improvements to reduce confusion and provide better guidance.
    *   **Duplicate Health Check Fix**: Consolidated health check configuration in General tab, removed duplicate from Other tab, added missing form field processing.
    *   **Tab Organization**: Reorganized tabs into logical groups (Core Settings, AI Models Group, Content Processing Group, Security, User Features, System Administration).
    *   **Workspace Dependency Validation**: Implemented real-time JavaScript validation to guide users when workspaces are enabled without required services (Azure AI Search, Document Intelligence, Embeddings).
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `route_external_health.py`)

*   **Admin Settings Tab Preservation Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where admin settings page would redirect to "General" tab after saving, rather than preserving the active tab.
    *   **Root Cause**: Server-side redirects lose hash fragments, and tab activation only checked URL hash on page load without restoration mechanism.
    *   **Solution**: Implemented client-side tab preservation using sessionStorage, enhanced with dual navigation interface support (traditional tabs and sidebar navigation).
    *   **User Experience**: Users can now save settings and remain in their current tab, reducing frustration and improving workflow efficiency.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.js`, tab restoration logic, session storage implementation)

*   **Workspace Scope Prompts Fix**
    *   Fixed workspace scope selector to affect both document filtering and prompt filtering consistently.
    *   **Issue**: Workspace scope selection only affected documents but not prompts, creating inconsistent user experience.
    *   **Solution**: Integrated prompt loading with workspace scope selector, implemented scope-aware filtering logic (All, Personal, Group, Public), added event listeners for scope changes.
    *   **Impact**: Consistent behavior between document and prompt filtering, improved workflow efficiency for users working within specific workspace contexts.
    *   (Ref: `chat-prompts.js`, `chat-global.js`, scope filtering implementation)

*   **External Links New Window Fix**
    *   Fixed web links in AI responses and user messages to open in new windows/tabs instead of replacing current chat session.
    *   **Root Cause**: External links in markdown content didn't include `target="_blank"` attribute after DOMPurify sanitization.
    *   **Solution**: Created `addTargetBlankToExternalLinks()` utility function that identifies external links and adds proper attributes including security measures.
    *   **Security Enhancement**: Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for enhanced security, maintains DOMPurify sanitization.
    *   (Ref: `chat-utils.js`, `chat-messages.js`, external link processing)

*   **Video Indexer Debug Logging Enhancement**
    *   Enhanced Video Indexer functionality with comprehensive debug logging to help diagnose API call failures and configuration issues.
    *   **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging for authentication, upload process, processing polling, insights extraction, chunk processing, and video deletion.
    *   **Troubleshooting Support**: Provides detailed error information, request/response data, and step-by-step processing details for customer support.
    *   **Integration**: Uses existing `debug_print` function with `enable_debug_logging` setting for controlled debugging without performance impact.
    *   (Ref: `functions_authentication.py`, `functions_documents.py`, Video Indexer workflow logging)

### **(v0.229.014)**

#### Bug Fixes

##### Public Workspace Management Fixes
*   **Public Workspace Management Permission Fix**
    *   Fixed incorrect permission checking for public workspace management operations when "Require Membership to Create Public Workspaces" setting was enabled.
    *   **Issue**: Users with legitimate access to manage workspaces (Owner/Admin/DocumentManager) were incorrectly shown "Forbidden" errors when accessing management functionality.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `manage_public_workspace` route was incorrectly decorated with `@create_public_workspace_role_required`, conflating creation permissions with management permissions.
    *   **Solution**: Removed the incorrect permission decorator from the management route, allowing workspace-specific membership roles to properly control access.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_public_workspaces.py`, workspace permission logic)

*   **Public Workspace Scope Display Enhancement**
    *   Enhanced the Public Workspace scope selector in chat interface to show specific workspace names instead of generic "Public" label.
    *   **Display Logic**: 
        *   No visible workspaces: `"Public"`
        *   1 visible workspace: `"Public: [Workspace Name]"`
        *   2-3 visible workspaces: `"Public: [Name1], [Name2], [Name3]"`
        *   More than 3 workspaces: `"Public: [Name1], [Name2], [Name3], 3+"`
    *   **Benefits**: Improved workspace identification, consistent with Group scope naming pattern, better navigation between workspace scopes.
    *   (Ref: `chat-documents.js`, scope label updates, dynamic workspace display)

=======
##### User Interface and Content Rendering Fixes
*   **Unicode Table Rendering Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where AI-generated tables using Unicode box-drawing characters were not rendering as proper HTML tables in the chat interface.
    *   **Problem**: AI agents (particularly ESAM Agent) generated Unicode tables that appeared as plain text instead of formatted tables.
    *   **Solution**: 
        *   Added `convertUnicodeTableToMarkdown()` function to detect and convert Unicode table patterns to markdown format
        *   Enhanced message processing pipeline to handle table preprocessing before markdown parsing
        *   Improved `unwrapTablesFromCodeBlocks()` function to detect tables mistakenly wrapped in code blocks
    *   **Impact**: Tables now render properly as HTML, improving readability and data presentation in chat responses.

# Feature Release

### **(v0.214.001)**

#### New Features

*   **Dark Mode Support**
    *   Added full dark mode theming with support for:
        *   Chat interface (left and right panes)
        *   File metadata panels
        *   Dropdowns, headers, buttons, and classification tables
    *   User preferences persist across sessions.
    *   Dark mode toggle in navbar with text labels and styling fixes (no flash during navigation).
*   **Admin Management Enhancements**
    *   **First-Time Configuration Wizard**: Introduced a guided setup wizard on the Admin Settings page. This wizard simplifies the initial configuration process for application basics (title, logo), GPT API settings, workspace settings, additional services (Embedding, AI Search, Document Intelligence), and optional features. (Ref: `README.md`, `admin_settings.js`, `admin_settings.html`)
    *   Admin Settings UI updated to show application version check status, comparing against the latest GitHub release. (Ref: `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `admin_settings.html`)
    *   Added `logout_hint` parameter to resolve multi-identity logout errors.
    *   Updated favicon and admin settings layout for improved clarity and usability.
*   **UI Banner & Visual Updates**
    *   **Enhanced Document Dropdown (Chat Interface)**: The document selection dropdown in the chat interface has been significantly improved:
        *   Increased width and scrollability for better handling of numerous documents.
        *   Client-side search/filter functionality added to quickly find documents.
        *   Improved visual feedback, including a "no matches found" message. (Ref: `chats.css`, `chat-documents.js`, `chats.html`)
    *   New top-of-page banner added (configurable).
    *   Local CSS/JS used across admin, group, and user workspaces for consistency and performance.
    *   Updated `base.html` and `workspace.html` to reflect visual improvements.
*   **Application Setup & Configuration**
    *   **Automatic Storage Container Creation**: The application now attempts to automatically create the `user-documents` and `group-documents` Azure Storage containers during initialization if they are not found, provided "Enhanced Citations" are enabled and a valid storage connection string is configured. Manual creation as per documentation is still the recommended primary approach. (Ref: `config.py`)
    *   Updated documentation for Azure Storage Account setup, including guidance for the new First-Time Configuration Wizard. (Ref: `README.md`)
*   **Security Improvements**
    *   Implemented `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to mitigate MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.
    *   Enhanced security for loading AI Search index schema JSON files by implementing path validation and using `secure_filename` in backend settings. (Ref: `route_backend_settings.py`)
*   **Build & Deployment**
    *   Added `docker_image_publish_dev.yml` GitHub Action workflow for publishing dev Docker images.
    *   Updated Dockerfile to use Python 3.12.
*   **Version Enforcement**
    *   GitHub workflow `enforce-dev-to-main.yml` added to prevent pull requests to `main` unless from `development`.

#### Bug Fixes

*   **A. Document Processing**
    *   **Document Deletion**: Resolved an issue where documents were not properly deleted from Azure Blob Storage. Now, when a document is deleted from the application, its corresponding blob is also removed from the `user-documents` or `group-documents` container if enhanced citations are enabled. (Ref: `functions_documents.py`)
    *   **Configuration Validation (Enhanced Citations)**: Added validation in Admin Settings to ensure that if "Enhanced Citations" is enabled, the "Office Docs Storage Account Connection String" is also provided. If the connection string is missing, Enhanced Citations will be automatically disabled, and a warning message will be displayed to the admin, preventing silent failures. (Ref: `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`)
*   **C. UI & Usability**
    *   **Local Assets for SimpleMDE**: The SimpleMDE Markdown editor assets (JS/CSS) are now served locally from `/static/js/simplemde/` and `/static/css/simplemde.min.css` instead of a CDN. This improves page load times, reduces external dependencies, and allows for use in offline or air-gapped environments. (Ref: `simplemde.min.js`, `simplemde.min.css` additions, template updates in `group_workspaces.html`, `workspace.html`)
    *   General CSS cleanups across admin and workspace UIs.
*   **D. General Stability**
    *   Merged contributions from multiple devs including UI fixes, backend updates, and config changes.
    *   Removed unused video/audio container declarations for a leaner frontend.

### Bug Fixes

#### A. AI Search Index Migration

- Automatically add any **missing** fields (e.g. `author`, `chunk_keywords`, `document_classification`, `page_number`, `start_time`, `video_ocr_chunk_text`, etc.) on every Admin page load.
- Fixed SDK usage (`Collection` attribute) to update index schema without full-index replacement.

#### B. User & Group Management

- **User search 401 error** when adding a new user to a group resolved by:
  - Implementing `SerializableTokenCache` in MSAL tied to Flask session.
  - Ensuring `_save_cache()` is called after `acquire_token_by_authorization_code`.

- **Fix new categories** error by seeding missing nested settings with defaults on startup.



### Breaking Changes & Migration Notes

- **Index schema** must be re-migrated via Admin Settings (admin initiates in the app settings page).

## (v0.203.15)

The update introduces "Workspaces," allowing users and groups to store both **documents** and **custom prompts** in a shared context. A new **prompt selection** feature enhances the chat workflow for a smoother experience. Additionally, admin configuration has been streamlined, and the landing page editor now supports improved Markdown formatting.

#### 1. Renaming Documents to Workspaces

- **Your Documents** → **Your Workspace**
- **Group Documents** → **Group Workspaces**
- All references, routes, and templates updated (`documents.html` → `workspace.html`, `group_documents.html` → `group_workspaces.html`).
- New admin settings flags: `enable_user_workspace` and `enable_group_workspaces` replaced the old `enable_user_documents` / `enable_group_documents`.

#### 2. Custom Prompt Support

- User Prompts:
  - New backend routes in `route_backend_prompts.py` (CRUD for user-specific prompts).
- Group Prompts:
  - New backend routes in `route_backend_group_prompts.py` (CRUD for group-shared prompts).

#### 3. Chat Page Enhancements

- Prompt Selection Dropdown:
  - New button (“Prompts”) toggles a dropdown for selecting saved user/group prompts.
  - Eliminates copy-paste; helps users insert larger or more complex prompts quickly.
  - Lays groundwork for future workflow automation.
- **Toast Notifications** for errors and status messages (replacing browser alerts).

#### 4. Cosmos Containers

- Added `prompts_container` and `group_prompts_container`.

- **Simplified** or standardized the container creation logic in `config.py`.

## (v0.202.41)

- **Azure Government Support**:

  - Introduced an `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` variable (e.g. `"public"` or `"usgovernment"`) and logic to handle separate authority hosts, resource managers, and credential scopes.

  ```
  # Azure Cosmos DB
  AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT="<your-cosmosdb-endpoint>"
  AZURE_COSMOS_KEY="<your-cosmosdb-key>"
  AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE="key" # key or managed_identity
  
  # Azure AD Authentication
  CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
  TENANT_ID="<your-tenant-id>"
  AZURE_ENVIRONMENT="public" #public, usgovernment
  SECRET_KEY="32-characters" # Example - "YouSh0uldGener8teYour0wnSecr3tKey!", import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
  ```

- **Admin Settings Overhaul**:

  - **Route & UI**: Added `route_backend_settings.py` and significantly expanded `admin_settings.html` to configure GPT, Embeddings, Image Gen, Content Safety, AI Search, and Document Intelligence—all from a single Admin page.
  - **APIM Toggles**: Each service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation, Content Safety, etc.) can now be routed through Azure API Management instead of direct endpoints by switching a toggle.
  - **“Test Connection” Buttons**: Each service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation, Content Safety, Azure AI Search, and Document Intelligence) now has a dedicated “Test Connection” button that performs a live connectivity check.

- **Improved Safety Features**:

  - New pages/sections for “Admin Safety Violations” vs. “My Safety Violations.”

- **Miscellaneous Frontend & Template Updates**:

  - All templates now reference an `app_settings.app_title` for a dynamic page title.
  - Enhanced navigation and labeling in “My Documents,” “My Groups,” and “Profile” pages.

### Bug Fixes

- **Conversation Pipeline**:
  - Removed the `"image"` role from the allowed conversation roles to streamline message handling.
- **Group Management**:
  - Now correctly passes and references the current user’s ID in various group actions.

## (v0.201.5)

#### 1. **Managed Identity Support**

- Azure Cosmos DB (enabled/disabled via environment variable)
- Azure Document Intelligence (enabled/disabled via app settings)
- Azure AI Search (enabled/disabled via app settings)
- Azure OpenAI (enabled/disabled via app settings)

#### 2. **Conversation Archiving**

- Introduced a new setting 

  ```
  enable_conversation_archiving
  ```

  - When enabled, deleting a conversation will first copy (archive) the conversation document into an `archived_conversations_container` before removing it from the main `conversations` container.
  - Helps preserve conversation history if you want to restore or analyze it later.

#### 3. **Configuration & Environment Variable Updates**

- `example.env` & `example_advance_edit_environment_variables.json`:
  - Added `AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE` to demonstrate how to switch between `key`-based or `managed_identity`-based authentication.
  - Cleaned up references to Azure AI Search and Azure Document Intelligence environment variables to reduce clutter and reflect the new approach of toggling authentication modes.
- Default Settings Updates
  - `functions_settings.py` has more descriptive defaults covering GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation for both key-based and managed identity scenarios.
  - New config fields such as `content_safety_authentication_type`, `azure_document_intelligence_authentication_type`, and `enable_conversation_archiving`.

#### 6. **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed bug affecting the ability to manage groups
  - Renamed or refactored `manage_groups.js` to `manage_group.js`, and updated the template (`manage_group.html`) to use the new filename.
  - Injected `groupId` directly via Jinja for improved client-side handling.

#### 7. **Architecture Diagram Updates**

- Updated `architecture.vsdx` and `architecture.png` to align with the new authentication flow and container usage.

------

#### How to Use / Test the New Features

1. **Enable Managed Identity**
   - In your `.env` or Azure App Service settings, set `AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE="managed_identity"` (and similarly for `azure_document_intelligence_authentication_type`, etc.).
   - Ensure the Azure resource (e.g., App Service, VM) has a system- or user-assigned Managed Identity with the correct roles (e.g., “Cosmos DB Account Contributor”).
   - Deploy, and the application will now connect to Azure resources without storing any keys in configuration.
2. **Test Conversation Archiving**
   - In the Admin Settings, enable `Enable Conversation Archiving`.
   - Delete a conversation.
   - Verify the record is copied to `archived_conversations_container` before being removed from the active container.
3. **Check New Environment Variables**
   - Review `example.env` and `example_advance_edit_environment_variables.json` for the newly added variables.
   - Update your application settings in Azure or your local `.env` accordingly to test various authentication modes (key vs. managed identity).

## (V0.199.3)

We introduced a robust user feedback system, expanded content-safety features for both admins and end users, added new Cosmos DB containers, and refined route-level permission toggles. These changes help administrators collect feedback on AI responses, manage content safety more seamlessly, and give end users clearer ways to manage their documents, groups, and personal logs. Enjoy the new functionality, and let us know if you have any questions or issues!

1. **New “User Feedback” System**
   - **Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down**: Users can now provide feedback on individual AI responses (when enabled in App Settings)
   - **Frontend Feedback Pages**:
     - **/my_feedback** page shows each user’s submitted feedback.
     - **/admin/feedback_review** page allows admins to review, filter, and manage all feedback.
2. **Extended Content Safety Features**
   - **New “Safety Violations” Page**: Admins can manage safety violations.
   - **New “My Safety Violations” Page**: Users can view their violations and add personal notes to each violation.
3. **New or Updated Database Containers**
   - feedback_container for user feedback.
   - archived_conversations_container / archived_feedback_container / archived_safety_container for long-term archival.
4. **Route-Level Feature Toggles**
   - **enabled_required(setting_key) Decorator**:
     - Dynamically block or allow routes based on an admin setting (e.g., enable_user_documents or enable_group_documents).
     - Reduces scattered if checks; you simply annotate the route.
5. **Conversation & Messaging Improvements**
   - **Unique message_id for Each Chat Message**:
     - Every user, assistant, safety, or image message now includes a message_id.
     - Makes it easier to tie user feedback or safety logs to a specific message.
   - **Public vs. Secret Settings**:
     - Frontend references a public_settings = sanitize_settings_for_user(settings) to avoid the potential to expose secrets on the client side.
6. **UI/UX Tweaks**
   - **Chat Layout Updates**:
     - “Start typing to create a new conversation…” message if none selected.
     - Automatic creation of new conversation when user tries to send a message with no active conversation.
   - **Navigation Bar Adjustments**:
     - Consolidated admin links into a dropdown.
     - “My Account” dropdown for quick access to “My Groups,” “My Feedback,” etc., if enabled.

## (v0.196.9)

1. **Content Safety Integration**
   - **New Safety Tab in Admin Settings**: A dedicated “Safety” section now appears under Admin Settings, allowing you to enable Azure Content Safety, configure its endpoint and key, and test connectivity.
   - **Real-Time Message Scanning**: If Content Safety is enabled, user prompts are scanned for potentially disallowed content. Blocked messages are flagged and a “safety” message is added to the conversation log in place of a normal AI reply.
   - **Admin Safety Logs**: Site admins (with “Admin” role) can view a new “Safety Violations” page (at /admin/safety_violations) showing blocked or flagged messages. Admins can update the status, action taken, or notes on each violation.
2. **Expanded APIM Support for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation**
   - **Fine-Grained APIM Toggles**: You can now enable or disable APIM usage independently for GPT, embeddings, and image generation. Each service has its own APIM endpoint, version, and subscription key fields in Admin Settings.
   - **UI-Driven Switching**: Check/uncheck “Enable APIM” to toggle between native Azure OpenAI endpoints or APIM-managed endpoints, all without redeploying the app.
3. **Workspaces & Documents Configuration**
   - **User Documents and Group Documents**: A new “Workspaces” tab in Admin Settings (replacing the old “Web Search” tab) lets you enable or disable user-specific documents and group-based documents.
   - **Group Documents Page**: The front-end for Group Documents now checks whether “Enable My Groups” is turned on. If enabled, members can manage shared group files and see group-level search results.
   - **My Groups & Group Management**: Navigation includes “My Groups” (if group features are enabled). This leads to a new set of pages for viewing groups, managing memberships, transferring ownership, and more.
4. **Search & Extract Tab**
   - **Azure AI Search & Document Intelligence**: Azure AI Search, and Azure Document Intelligence settings into a new “Search and Extract” tab (replacing the older “Web Search” tab).
   - **Azure Document Intelligence**: Configure endpoints and keys for file ingestion (OCR, form analysis, etc.) in a more structured place within Admin Settings.
5. **Updated UI & Navigation**
   - **Admin Dropdown**: Admin-specific features (App Settings, Safety Violations, etc.) are grouped in an “Admin” dropdown on the main navbar.
   - **Safety**: For Content Safety (as noted above).
   - **Search & Extract**: For Azure AI Search, and Document Intelligence.
   - **Minor Styling Adjustments**: Updated top navbar to show/hide “Groups” or “Documents” links based on new toggles (Enable Your Documents, Enable My Groups).

## (v0.191.0)

1. **Azure API Management (APIM) Support**  
   - **New APIM Toggles**: In the Admin Settings, you can now enable or disable APIM usage separately for GPT, embeddings, and image generation.  
   - **APIM Endpoints & Subscription Keys**: For each AI service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation), you can specify an APIM endpoint, version, deployment, and subscription key—allowing a unified API gateway approach (e.g., rate limiting, authentication) without changing your core service code.  
   - **Seamless Switching**: A single checkbox (`Enable APIM`) within each tab (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation) instantly switches the app between native Azure endpoints and APIM-protected endpoints, with no redeployment required.

2. **Enhanced Admin Settings UI**  
   - **Advanced Fields**: Collapsible “Show Advanced” sections for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation let you configure API versions or other fine-tuning details only when needed.

   - Configure Azure OpenAI GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation settings directly through an in-app interface (rather than `.env`).  
   - Choose between **key-based** or **managed identity** authentication for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation.  
   - Dynamically switch models/deployments without redeploying the app.

2. **Multiple Roles & Group Permissions**  
   - Roles include `Owner`, `Admin`, `DocumentManager`, and `User`.  
   - Group Owners/Admins can invite or remove members, manage documents, and set “active workspace” for group-based search.

3. **One-Click Switching of Active Group**  
   - Users in multiple groups can quickly switch their active group to see group-specific documents and chat references.

4. **Ephemeral Document Upload**  
   - Upload a file for a single conversation. The file is not saved in Azure Cognitive Search; instead, it is only used for the session’s RAG context.

5. **Inline File Previews in Chat**  
   - Files attached to a conversation can be previewed directly from the chat, with text or data displayed in a pop-up.

7. **Optional Image Generation**  
   - Users can toggle an “Image” button to create images via Azure OpenAI (e.g., DALL·E) when configured in Admin Settings.

8. **App Roles & Enterprise Application**  
   - Provides a robust way to control user access at scale.  
   - Admins can assign roles to new users or entire Azure AD groups.
